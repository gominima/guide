If you're reading this, it probably means you want to learn how to use Minima Awesome! You've come to the right place. This guide will teach you things such as:

How to get a basic server up and running from scratch;
How to properly create, organize, and expand on your routes;
In-depth explanations and examples regarding popular topics;
Working with databases (e.g. sequelize and keyv);
And much more.

## Before you begin...

Alright, making a server is cool and all, but there are some prerequisites to it. To create a server with Minima, you should have a fairly decent grasp of Go itself. While you can make a server with very little Go and programming knowledge, trying to do so without understanding the language first will only hinder you. You may get stuck on many uncomplicated issues, struggle with solutions to incredibly easy problems, and all-in-all end up frustrated. Sounds pretty annoying.

Learn some Go, and once you feel like you're confident enough to make a server, come back and get started!
